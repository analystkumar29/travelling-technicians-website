# Auth Navigation System Improvements

## Overview

This update improves the authentication and navigation system to fix issues with redirect loops between protected routes and homepage. The primary improvements are:

1. **Enhanced Router Error Guard**: Improved protection against incorrect loop detection and false positives
2. **Robust Auth Protection**: Better authentication state validation and recovery mechanisms
3. **Safe Auth Navigation Hook**: New hook to handle navigation to protected routes safely
4. **Better Auth State Management**: Improved state persistence and recovery

## How to Use 

### For Developers

Use the new `useAuthNavigation` hook instead of the regular Next.js router for protected routes:

```javascript
import useAuthNavigation from '@/hooks/useAuthNavigation';

function YourComponent() {
  const authNavigation = useAuthNavigation();
  
  // Navigate to protected routes safely
  const goToProfile = () => {
    authNavigation.navigateToProfile();
  };
  
  // Or use the general purpose method
  const goToCustomPage = () => {
    authNavigation.navigateToProtectedRoute('/your/protected/route');
  };
}
```

### For Users Experiencing Issues

If users experience navigation issues:

1. Run the cleanup script in browser console:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   fetch('/auth-cleanup.js').then(r => r.text()).then(t => eval(t))
   ```

2. Or use the emergency reset button that appears when issues are detected
3. Clear browser cache and cookies related to the site
4. Sign out completely and sign back in

### For Site Administrators

If many users report issues:

1. Run the cleanup script on the server:
   ```bash
   npm run clean:auth
   ```

2. Rebuild and deploy the application
