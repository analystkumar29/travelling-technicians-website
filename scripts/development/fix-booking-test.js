/**
 * Booking API Tests - Summary of Findings and Fixes
 * 
 * Issue Diagnosed:
 * 1. The booking API fails with "record 'new' has no field 'brand'" when trying to insert a booking
 * 2. After examining the normalizeBookingData and denormalizeBookingData functions, we discovered that
 *    there is a mismatch between the transformer expectations and the database schema
 * 3. Specifically, the normalizeBookingData function returns data with fields "city" and "province" in 
 *    the location object, but these fields don't exist in the database schema
 * 4. When the API tries to insert data into the database, those missing fields cause an error
 * 
 * Recommended Fixes:
 * 
 * 1. Update the BookingTransformer.ts file to not include city and province fields in denormalizeBookingData:
 *    - Add a comment in denormalizeBookingData to explicitly NOT include city and province
 * 
 * 2. Fix the create.ts API endpoint:
 *    - Modify the bookingData creation to only include fields that exist in the database schema
 *    - Remove any reference to city or province in the insertion logic
 * 
 * 3. Fix Database Schema (if city/province are needed):
 *    - Add city and province columns to the bookings table
 *    - Execute SQL:
 *      ALTER TABLE bookings 
 *      ADD COLUMN city TEXT,
 *      ADD COLUMN province TEXT;
 * 
 * 4. Long-term fix: Add thorough validation:
 *    - Implement Zod or similar schema validation to ensure API data matches the database schema
 *    - Add database schema versioning and migration tools
 *    - Add comprehensive tests for the booking flow
 * 
 * Note: There may also be a trigger in the database that is trying to access a 'brand' field that
 * was not visible in our schema examination. This would need investigation directly in Supabase.

// Sample transformer fix:
/*
export function denormalizeBookingData(bookingData: Partial<CreateBookingRequest>): Record<string, any> {
  // Handle tablet device type for API compatibility
  const apiDeviceType = bookingData.deviceType === 'tablet' ? 'mobile' : bookingData.deviceType;
  
  return {
    ...(bookingData.deviceType && { device_type: apiDeviceType }),
    ...(bookingData.deviceBrand && { device_brand: bookingData.deviceBrand }),
    ...(bookingData.deviceModel && { device_model: bookingData.deviceModel }),
    ...(bookingData.serviceType && { service_type: bookingData.serviceType }),
    ...(bookingData.issueDescription && { issue_description: bookingData.issueDescription }),
    
    ...(bookingData.appointmentDate && { booking_date: bookingData.appointmentDate }),
    ...(bookingData.appointmentTime && { booking_time: bookingData.appointmentTime }),
    
    ...(bookingData.customerName && { customer_name: bookingData.customerName }),
    ...(bookingData.customerEmail && { customer_email: bookingData.customerEmail }),
    ...(bookingData.customerPhone && { customer_phone: bookingData.customerPhone }),
    
    ...(bookingData.address && { address: bookingData.address }),
    ...(bookingData.postalCode && { postal_code: bookingData.postalCode }),
    // Explicitly NOT including city and province fields since they don't exist in the database schema
  };
}
*/

// Sample test code that should work once the fix is implemented:
/*
// Test minimal booking API call
const minimalBookingData = {
  deviceType: 'mobile',
  deviceBrand: 'Apple',
  serviceType: 'screen_replacement',
  appointmentDate: '2025-05-14',
  appointmentTime: '14:00-16:00',
  customerName: 'Minimal Test Customer',
  customerEmail: 'minimal-test@example.com',
  customerPhone: '604-123-4567',
  address: '123 Test Street, Vancouver, BC',
  postalCode: 'V6B 1S5'
};

// This should succeed after fixing the transformer
