# Master Dataset Creation Summary
**The Travelling Technicians - MobileActive Data Extraction & Master Dataset**

## 🎯 Project Overview

We've successfully created a **master dataset system** that will serve as the foundation for your pricing system. This approach ensures you only offer services for parts you actually have in stock, rather than importing random pricing data.

## 📊 What We Accomplished

### 1. Data Extraction & Cleaning
- **Extracted 8,772 raw products** from MobileActive.ca
- **Cleaned and validated 5,801 products** (66.13% success rate)
- **Standardized data format** across all products
- **Detected quality tiers, assembly types, and availability**

### 2. Master Dataset Creation
- **Created 5,801 master records** with standardized structure
- **Mapped to 7 brands**: Samsung (3,216), Apple (2,015), Google (474), Asus (66), Xiaomi (16), Huawei (9), OnePlus (5)
- **Covered 7 services**: Screen replacement (2,367), Camera repair (960), Charging port repair (733), Back cover replacement (703), Battery replacement (598), Speaker repair (413), Microphone repair (27)
- **Identified 5 quality tiers**: Economy (2,836), Premium (1,178), Aftermarket (1,226), OEM (226), Refurbished (335)

### 3. Database Schema Design
- **Created comprehensive database schema** for multi-supplier system
- **Designed for scalability** - easy to add new suppliers
- **Separated supplier data** from customer-facing pricing
- **Included availability tracking** and quality differentiation

## 📁 Files Generated

### Data Files
- `tmp/master-dataset.json` - Complete master dataset (5,801 records)
- `tmp/master-dataset.csv` - CSV export for easy review
- `tmp/supplier-summary.json` - Summary statistics

### Database Files
- `tmp/database-schema.sql` - Complete database schema
- `tmp/schema-documentation.md` - Detailed schema documentation

### Analysis Files
- `tmp/pricing-pattern-analysis.json` - Pricing pattern analysis
- `tmp/pricing-categories.csv` - Quality tier categorization

## 🏗️ Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
- **suppliers** - MobileActive, MobileSentrix, etc.
- **device_types** - Mobile, tablet, laptop
- **brands** - Apple, Samsung, etc.
- **device_models** - iPhone 15, Galaxy S24, etc.
- **service_types** - Screen replacement, battery replacement, etc.
- **quality_tiers** - Economy, aftermarket, premium, OEM, refurbished
- **assembly_types** - Screen only, with frame, digitizer only

### Inventory Tables
- **parts_inventory** - Master parts catalog from all suppliers
- **dynamic_pricing** - Customer-facing pricing matrix

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

```
Supplier Data (MobileActive) → Master Dataset → Database Tables → Customer Pricing
     ↓                              ↓              ↓              ↓
Raw Products → Cleaned Data → parts_inventory → dynamic_pricing → Website
```

## 💡 Key Benefits

### 1. **Availability Tracking**
- Only offer services for parts you actually have
- Real-time stock status from suppliers
- Lead time information for planning

### 2. **Quality Differentiation**
- Support multiple quality tiers per service
- Clear warranty and turnaround time information
- Customer choice based on budget and needs

### 3. **Supplier Independence**
- Add new suppliers without changing core structure
- Compare pricing across suppliers
- Backup suppliers for critical parts

### 4. **Flexible Pricing**
- Dynamic pricing based on parts cost + markup
- Support for promotional pricing
- Location-based adjustments

## 📈 Pricing Tier Analysis

Based on real MobileActive data:
- **2 price points**: 110 model/service groups
- **3 price points**: 68 model/service groups  
- **4 price points**: 39 model/service groups
- **5+ price points**: 112 model/service groups

**Recommendation**: Use **4 tiers** (Economy, Standard, Premium, Express) to capture the full market range.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. **Review the generated schema** (`tmp/database-schema.sql`)
2. **Customize tables** as needed for your specific requirements
3. **Create tables** in your Supabase database
4. **Import master dataset** to `parts_inventory` table

### Phase 2: MobileSentrix Integration
1. **Extract MobileSentrix data** using similar process
2. **Standardize to master dataset format**
3. **Merge with existing MobileActive data**
4. **Update availability and pricing**

### Phase 3: Pricing Generation
1. **Generate customer-facing pricing** from parts inventory
2. **Apply quality tier multipliers** to create pricing tiers
3. **Populate dynamic_pricing table**
4. **Update website** to use new pricing system

### Phase 4: Automation
1. **Create automated data sync** from suppliers
2. **Build admin interface** for managing parts inventory
3. **Implement availability alerts** for low stock
4. **Add supplier comparison tools**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Master Dataset Structure
Each record includes:
- **Core identifiers**: Supplier, product ID, SKU
- **Device information**: Type, brand, model, variant, year
- **Service information**: Repair type
- **Part information**: Title, quality tier, assembly type
- **Pricing information**: Cost price, suggested retail
- **Availability information**: Status, stock, lead time
- **Supplier information**: URL, image, metadata

### Quality Tier Detection
- **OEM**: Original equipment manufacturer parts
- **Premium**: High-quality aftermarket parts
- **Aftermarket**: Standard aftermarket parts
- **Economy**: Budget-friendly parts
- **Refurbished**: Refurbished original parts

### Availability Status
- **in_stock**: Available for immediate use
- **limited_stock**: Low quantity available
- **out_of_stock**: Currently unavailable
- **discontinued**: No longer available
- **unknown**: Status unclear

## 📊 Business Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Accurate pricing** based on actual parts cost
- **Availability transparency** for customers
- **Quality differentiation** to increase average order value
