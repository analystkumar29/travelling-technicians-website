# üîê Security Incident Resolution

## Issue Summary
GitGuardian detected 3 security incidents where sensitive credentials were accidentally committed to the repository:

1. **Generic High Entropy Secret** - Hardcoded JWT tokens
2. **Supabase Service Role JWT** - Exposed service role key
3. **JSON Web Token** - Exposed authentication tokens

## üö® Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Secrets
The following files contained hardcoded credentials that have been fixed:

- `update-warranty-system.js` - Replaced hardcoded Supabase keys with environment variables
- `setup-admin-auth.js` - Replaced hardcoded keys with placeholder values
- `run-migration-with-env.js` - Replaced hardcoded service role key with environment variable loading
- `run-warranty-cli.js` - Replaced hardcoded service role key with environment variable loading
- `.cleanup-backup/` - Removed entire backup directory containing exposed credentials

### 2. Enhanced Environment Variable Loading
All scripts now properly load environment variables using:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```

### 3. Added Validation
Scripts now validate that required environment variables are set before proceeding.

## üîÑ Required Actions for Full Security

### CRITICAL: Regenerate Compromised Credentials

**You MUST regenerate these credentials immediately:**

1. **Supabase Keys**
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to Settings > API
   - Click "Reset" on both:
     - `anon` key
     - `service_role` key

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   After regenerating Supabase keys, update these in:
   - `.env.local` (development)
   - `.env.production` (production)
   - Vercel dashboard (production deployment)

### Environment Variables to Update:
```bash
# Get new keys from Supabase Dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_new_service_role_key_here
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Proper .gitignore Configuration
The `.gitignore` file correctly excludes:
```
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```

### 2. Environment Variable Validation
Scripts now check for required environment variables:
```javascript
if (!process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) {
  console.error('‚ùå SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable is required');
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### 3. Placeholder Values in Setup Scripts
Setup scripts use placeholder values instead of real credentials:
```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [x] Removed all hardcoded secrets from repository
- [x] Added proper environment variable loading
- [x] Added validation for required environment variables
- [x] Removed backup files containing secrets
- [x] Updated .gitignore to prevent future incidents
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Regenerate Supabase credentials
- [ ] Update all environment files with new credentials
- [ ] Update Vercel deployment with new credentials
- [ ] Test website functionality with new credentials

## üîç How to Verify Security

1. **Check Repository**: Search for any remaining secrets
   ```bash
   grep -r "eyJ" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
   ```

2. **Test Environment Loading**: Ensure all scripts load environment variables properly
   ```bash
   node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('SUPABASE_URL:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET')"
   ```

3. **Verify Website Function**: After updating credentials, test:
   - Homepage loads correctly
   - Booking system works
   - Database connections are successful

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Required)**:
   - Regenerate Supabase credentials
   - Update all environment variables
   - Test website functionality

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD
   - Add pre-commit hooks to prevent credential commits
   - Regular security audits

3. **Long-term**:
   - Consider using managed secrets (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
   - Implement secret rotation policies
   - Regular penetration testing

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues after implementing these fixes:
1. Check that all environment variables are properly set
2. Verify new Supabase credentials are active
3. Test database connectivity
4. Review server logs for specific error messages

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This security incident is resolved from a code perspective, but the compromised credentials MUST be regenerated to ensure complete security.
