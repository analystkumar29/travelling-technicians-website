## Key Files Fixed

- `src/components/common/SafeImage.tsx`: Fixed missing isLoading state
- `src/context/BookingContext.tsx`: Corrected error handling in try-catch blocks
- `src/services/api.ts`: Created missing API utilities
- `src/services/apiUtils.ts`: Implemented proper API request handlers
- `src/services/bookingService.ts`: Fixed field transformation issues
- `src/services/emailService.ts`: Corrected URL parsing for email confirmation
- `src/types/booking.ts`: Made city and province required fields
- `src/pages/book-online.tsx`: Fixed form submission and error handling
- `src/pages/api/bookings/create.ts`: Improved field validation and error handling

## Deployment Instructions

1. Pull the latest changes from the main branch
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date
3. Build the application with `npm run build`
4. Deploy to production server
5. Verify that booking system and email functionality are working properly

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise with version 2.0.0, you can roll back to the previous version:

```bash
git checkout main-v1-backup
git push -f origin main-v1-backup:main
```

This will restore the main branch to its pre-v2.0.0 state.
