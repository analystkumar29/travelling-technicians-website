## Rollback Instructions

If any issues occur after implementing a step, you can roll back changes using:

```bash
# To discard changes in a specific file
git checkout -- path/to/file

# To revert to a specific commit
git revert [commit-hash]

# To completely reset to a previous commit (use with caution)
git reset --hard [commit-hash]
```

Remember to commit your changes after each step to maintain a clean history and enable easy rollbacks if needed.
