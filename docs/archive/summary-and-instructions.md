# Booking System Database Update Summary

## Findings

1. The booking system is experiencing errors with the database schema. The primary error we've identified is:
   ```
   record "new" has no field "brand"
   record "new" has no field "model"
   ```

2. These errors suggest that there's a database trigger that's trying to access fields named `brand` and `model`, but these fields don't exist in the database schema.

3. The schema expects fields like `device_brand` and `device_model`, but the transformer or trigger might be looking for `brand` and `model` directly.

4. We've also identified that the booking system expects `city` and `province` fields, which might be missing from the database schema.

## Changes Made

1. We've added the following fields to the database schema:
   - `city` (TEXT)
   - `province` (TEXT)
   - `brand` (TEXT)
   - `model` (TEXT)

2. These changes should address the immediate schema issues, allowing triggers and transformers to find the fields they're expecting.

## Next Steps

To fully fix the issue:

1. **Update/Fix the API Endpoint**:
   - The API endpoint still returns a 400 error. Review the validation logic in `src/pages/api/bookings/create.ts` to ensure it's checking for the correct fields and formats.
   - Debug the exact validation failure by adding detailed logging to the create API endpoint.

2. **Update Booking Transformers**:
   - Check if `src/services/transformers/bookingTransformer.ts` needs to be updated to handle the new fields correctly.
   - Ensure the `denormalizeBookingData` function maps frontend fields to database fields correctly.
   - Ensure the `normalizeBookingData` function maps database fields to frontend fields correctly.

3. **Test with Modified API Data**:
   - Try different field combinations in the API request to identify which specific field is failing validation.

4. **Verify Database Triggers**:
   - Check for any triggers in the Supabase database that might be expecting specific field names.
   - Consider modifying those triggers to work with the existing schema.

## Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Add Schema Validation**:
   - Implement a schema validation library like Zod to ensure API requests and database fields match.
   - This would catch errors before they reach the database.

2. **Database Migration System**:
   - Consider implementing a proper database migration system to track and manage schema changes.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Add more automated tests to verify the entire booking flow.
   - Test each step of the process independently.

## Manual Fix Instructions

If you need to quickly fix this in production, you can run this SQL in the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add missing columns to the bookings table
ALTER TABLE public.bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;
ALTER TABLE public.bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS province TEXT;
ALTER TABLE public.bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS brand TEXT;
ALTER TABLE public.bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS model TEXT;
```

Then review and update the API validation logic to ensure it aligns with the expected fields in the frontend and database.
