## 💡 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **Root Cause Resolution**
The original redirect loop was caused by **domain-level redirects** conflicting with application-level canonical URLs. By switching to www as canonical, we aligned with the existing domain redirect rather than fighting it.

### **Implementation Strategy**
**Comprehensive approach** was key - updating just canonical URLs without updating schema markup and sitemaps would have created new conflicts. The systematic update of all related elements ensured complete resolution.

### **Testing Importance**
**Multi-level testing** (accessibility, redirects, canonical consistency) validated that all changes work together correctly without introducing new issues.

3. **Track performance improvements** in search rankings
4. **Maintain monitoring schedule** as outlined above
5. **Update any external references** that might use old non-www URLs
