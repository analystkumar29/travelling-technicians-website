# 📧 SendGrid Subject Line Fix Guide

## 🚨 Problem
Emails are being sent with "(no subject)" because SendGrid Dynamic Templates ignore the `subject` field from API calls.

## ✅ Solution
You need to update your SendGrid template to include a dynamic subject line.

## 🔧 Steps to Fix in SendGrid Dashboard

### Step 1: Login to SendGrid
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com
2. Login with your SendGrid account

### Step 2: Navigate to Templates
1. Go to **Email API** → **Dynamic Templates**
2. Find your template (ID: `d-c9dbac568573432bb15f79c92c4fd4b5`)
3. Click on the template name

### Step 3: Edit Template Subject
1. Click **"Edit"** on your active template version
2. Look for **"Settings"** on the left sidebar (may be a gear icon)
3. Click **"Settings"** to open template settings
4. In the **"Subject"** field, replace any existing text with:
   ```
   {{{subject}}}
   ```
   
### Step 4: Save and Activate
1. Click **"Save"** 
2. Make sure the template is marked as **"Active"**
3. You should see a green "Active" badge

## 🎯 What This Does
- `{{{subject}}}` is Handlebars syntax for dynamic content
- This tells SendGrid to use the `subject` value from `dynamicTemplateData`
- Our API now sends the subject in the data instead of the subject field

## 📝 Code Changes Made
I've already updated your APIs to include the subject in `dynamicTemplateData`:

**Confirmation Emails:**
```javascript
dynamicTemplateData: {
  subject: 'Booking Confirmation - The Travelling Technicians',
  // ... rest of data
}
```

**Reschedule Emails:**
```javascript
dynamicTemplateData: {
  subject: 'Booking Rescheduled - The Travelling Technicians', 
  // ... rest of data
}
```

## 🚀 After You Update the Template
1. Test by creating a new booking - you should see proper subjects
2. Test reschedule functionality - subjects should appear correctly
3. Both emails will show proper subject lines

## ❓ Alternative Solution (If Template Won't Update)
If you can't access the SendGrid template, I can switch the emails to use plain HTML instead of templates, which allows API subject override. Let me know if you need this approach!

## 🔍 Verification
After making the SendGrid template change:
1. The emails will have proper subject lines
2. No more "(no subject)" in email clients
3. Both booking confirmations and reschedule emails will work correctly
