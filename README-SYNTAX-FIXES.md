# The Travelling Technicians Website - Syntax Error Fixes

This document explains the syntax errors that were causing the "Invalid or unexpected token" error in the project and how they were fixed.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error in AddressAutocomplete.tsx

The main issue was in `src/components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx` where an `obj.data` reference was causing a TypeScript error:

```diff
- setShowSuggestions(data && obj.data.length > 0);
+ setShowSuggestions(data && data.length > 0);
```

This was causing a runtime error because `obj` was undefined.

### 2. Regex Escape Sequences in PostalCodeChecker.tsx

In `src/components/PostalCodeChecker.tsx`, there were improperly escaped regex patterns:

```diff
- onChange={(e) => setPostalCode(e.target.value.toUpperCase().replace(/\\s+/g, ' ').trim())}
+ onChange={(e) => setPostalCode(e.target.value.toUpperCase().replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim())}
```

Escaped backslashes in regex patterns within template literals need special attention to avoid syntax errors.

### 3. Template Literals in UnsplashImage.tsx

In `src/components/common/UnsplashImage.tsx`, there was a need to ensure template literals are properly balanced:

```diff
- const imageUrl = `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-${imageId}?q=${quality}&w=${imgWidth}${imgHeight ? `&h=${imgHeight}
+ const imageUrl = `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-${imageId}?q=${quality}&w=${imgWidth}${imgHeight ? `&h=${imgHeight}` : ''}`;
```

### 4. Next.js Configuration Warnings

In `next.config.js`, removed unrecognized options that were causing warnings:

```diff
- serverExternalPackages: ['some-package'],
```

## The Fix Script

A comprehensive fix script (`complete-fix.js`) was created to automatically address all of these issues. The script:

1. Fixes the TypeScript error in AddressAutocomplete.tsx
2. Corrects regex escape sequences in PostalCodeChecker.tsx
3. Ensures template literals are properly balanced in UnsplashImage.tsx
4. Removes unrecognized options from next.config.js
5. Checks for problematic Next.js router patches and removes them
6. Cleans build artifacts for a fresh start

## Preventing Future Issues

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Be careful with nested template literals - always ensure they're properly closed
2. When using regex patterns in JavaScript strings, remember proper escaping rules
3. Avoid direct references to undefined objects or properties
4. Use error boundaries and runtime safeguards like those already in your project
5. Always run TypeScript checks before deployment
6. Be cautious when applying patches to Next.js internal files

## Running Your Application

After fixing these issues, you can start your application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now run without the "Invalid or unexpected token" syntax error.
