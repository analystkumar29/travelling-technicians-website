# Tier Structure Merge - Documentation

## Date: January 17, 2025

## Summary
Successfully merged Economy tier with Standard tier and simplified the pricing structure from 4 tiers to 2 tiers.

## Changes Made

### Database Changes
- **Merged Economy tier (ID: 1) with Standard tier (ID: 2)**
  - Economy entry: iPhone 16 Pro Max camera-repair ($100) → converted to Standard tier
  - Total Standard tier entries: 911 (was 910 + 1 from Economy)

- **Deleted unused tiers:**
  - ❌ Economy tier (ID: 1) - Multiplier: 0.85
  - ❌ Express tier (ID: 4) - Multiplier: 1.5

### Final Tier Structure
| Tier | ID | Multiplier | Entries | Status |
|------|----|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Standard** | 2 | 1.0x | 911 | ✅ Active |
| **Premium** | 3 | 1.25x | 0 | ✅ Ready for use |

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Management** - Only 2 tiers instead of 4
2. **No Data Loss** - All pricing entries preserved
3. **Consistent Pricing** - Economy prices merged into Standard
4. **Future-Ready** - Premium tier available for new entries
5. **User-Friendly** - Simpler tier selection in booking form

## Testing Results
- ✅ Standard tier pricing works correctly
- ✅ Premium tier uses fallback pricing (1.25x multiplier)
- ✅ Management panel reflects new structure
- ✅ Booking form compatible (already configured for 2 tiers)

## Technical Details
- **Database Operation**: Direct SQL updates to `pricing_tiers` and `dynamic_pricing` tables
- **No Code Changes**: Existing code already supported 2-tier structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing pricing entries maintained
- **API Compatibility**: All pricing APIs work with new structure

## Impact
- **Pricing System**: Fully functional with simplified structure
- **Management Panel**: Automatically updated to show only Standard and Premium
- **Booking Flow**: No changes needed, already configured for 2 tiers
- **Customer Experience**: Cleaner, simpler tier selection

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add Premium tier pricing entries via management panel
- Set Premium prices 25% higher than Standard (due to 1.25x multiplier)
- Consider Premium-specific features (faster turnaround, extended warranty)
