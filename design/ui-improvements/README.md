# UI Improvement Design Assets

This directory contains design assets for the UI improvements project, including:

- Logo designs and variations
- Color palette references
- Typography guidelines
- Component mockups
- Before/after screenshots for documentation

## Organization

- `/logos` - Logo files in various formats (SVG, PNG)
- `/mockups` - Component and page design mockups
- `/screenshots` - Before/after screenshots of UI changes
- `/reference` - Reference materials and inspiration

## Guidelines

1. Save all image assets in appropriate formats:
   - SVG for vector graphics (logos, icons)
   - PNG for raster graphics with transparency
   - JPG for photos and complex images without transparency
   - WebP for optimized web images

2. Use consistent naming conventions:
   - All lowercase
   - Hyphen-separated words
   - Include dimensions for raster images (e.g. `logo-dark-250x100.png`)

3. Document the source of any external assets or inspiration

4. For each step of the UI improvement plan, save before/after screenshots to track progress
