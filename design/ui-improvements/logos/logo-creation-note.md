# Logo Creation Notes

## Logo Files Created
- SVG logo at `/public/images/logo.svg`
- For the PNG version, export the SVG at multiple resolutions:
  - `/public/images/logo.png` (220x80px)
  - `/public/images/logo-2x.png` (440x160px for high-DPI displays)
  - `/public/images/logo-small.png` (110x40px for mobile)
  - `/public/images/favicon.png` (32x32px for favicon)

## Logo Design Concept
The logo combines several elements that represent The Travelling Technicians business:
- Winding road with car: represents the "travelling" aspect
- Phone with technician icon: represents mobile device repair
- Home icon: represents doorstep service
- Color scheme: Teal (#0d9488) and Navy (#1e293b) from our Tailwind theme

## Responsive Usage
- Desktop header: Full logo with text to the right
- Mobile header: Simplified logo without text
- Favicon: Ultra-simplified version showing just the phone icon
